Reference : ATP III, NCEP Guidelines and National Lipid Association (NLA) 2014 Recommendations
As per most international and national guidelines including Lipid Association of India 2016 :
1. Lipoprotein and lipid levels should be considered in conjunction with other atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
risk determinants to assess treatment goals and strategies.
2. Non-fasting lipid levels can be used in screening and in general risk estimation.

Test Description
Observed Value
Biological Reference Interval
TEST NAME
Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1C), by HPLC
6.60
4.0 to 5.6 %
Interpretation :
HbA1C level reflects the mean glucose concentration over previous 8-12 weeks and provides better
indication of long term glycemic control.
For diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (>/= 18 yrs of age) :
5.7 % - 6.4 % : Increased risk for developing diabetes.
>/=6.5% : Diabetes
Therapeutic goals for glycemic control :
Adults : < 7%
Toddlers and Preschoolers : < 8.5% (but > 7.5 %)
School age (6-12 yrs) : < 8%
Adolescents and young adults (13 - 19 yrs) : < 7.5%
Levels of HbA1C may be low as result of shortened RBC life span in case of hemolytic anemia.
Increased HbA1C values may be found in patients with polycythemia or post splenectomy patients.
Patients with Homozygous forms of rare variant Hb(CC,SS,EE,SC) HbA1c can not be quantitated as there
is no HbA. In such circumstances glycemic control can be monitored using plasma glucose levels or
serum Fructosamine.
The A1c target should be individualized based on numerous factors, such as age, life expectancy,
comorbid conditions, duration of diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia or adverse consequences from
hypoglycemia, patient motivation and adherence.
